In July, 2016. I attended the 4th CLS/McG neuroscience summer school in Peking University. Research InterestI’m interested in cognitive neuroscience. I would like to seek for how our brain interpret the sensory signal, particularly the visual perception. Topics including attentional modulation, the expectation effect and the predictive coding in sensory processing. At present, I’m trying to interpret why intermittent presented SFM can stablization subject’s perception. Using combination of psychphysical experiments and functional imagining. Lab Experience2016 03 - NOWUndergraduate Researcher, International Center for Cognitive Science and Engineering, Xi’an Jiaotong University Advisor: Prof. Badong Chen Project 1 : Visual image reconstruction using fMRI(In March, 2016)&gt; I tried to repeat some previous research, such as decode fMRI signal from primary visual cortex (V1) and reconstruct pattern image from fMRI signal (Miyawaki et al., 2008), meanwhile, I improved the accuracy of the reconstruction by about 4% (from about 80% to about 84%), using the improved MVPA method with SVM classifier (Norman et al., 2006).For more detail: Click HERE Project 2 : Modeling fMRI voxels dynamics with natural image stimulus(In May, 2016) Also, I tried to repeat another pioneering research published on NATURE (Kay et al., 2008), using the Voxel-Wise Model (Naselaris et al., 2011), I successfully constructed a liner receptive field model for every voxels using the Gabor wavelet filter according to the encoding theory of the primary visual cortex (Hubel and Wiesel, 1968), without noise ceiling procedures I also got remarkable accuracy in the identification task (about 48.8%, meanwhile the chance level is about 0.8%).For more detail: Click HERE Project 3 : How visual working memory effects visual perception(Sep. 2016 - NOW) In this project, I am trying to carry out my own independent research projrct for the first time. I am using a combination of psychophysics experiments, and functional imaging(fMRI, EEG). My results indicated that the working memory task could improve the perceptual memory performance via enhancing the internally directed attention, and the internally directed attention is strongly correlated with the perceptual memory phenomenon. The pre-activation of the visual cortex also play important role in this phenomenon. I have submitted these current findings to the Visual Science Society annual meeting as an abstract (Dec. 2016).

Data set: Kay, K.N.; Naselaris, T.; Gallant, J. (2011): fMRI of human visual areas in response to natural images. CRCNS.org.http://dx.doi.org/10.6080/K0QN64NG Stimulus Figure 1. A given example of the natural image stimulus Subjects view 1870 images while recording their brain activities using fMRI. 1750 of these are for training, the remaining is the test set. After the pre-processing procedure. They used GLM to estimate response for every images. Then they choose about 25000 voxels from (V1, V2, V3, V3a, V3b, V4, LatOcc etc.). MethodOverview Figure 2. The overview of the data processing procedures. Mainly in three parts, feature extractions, voxels selection, and main training stage. In order to modeling voxels’ tunning dynamic. We use this three-stage method. Including feature extractions, voxels selection, and main training(modeling)stage. Procedures &amp; ResultsExtract featuresAccording the theory of the encoding mechanism of the early visual cortex (EVC). Neurons in EVC firing for some particular orientation and spacial frequency in a particular visual position, which we called the receptive field. In fMRI, the activity patterns in the human visual cortex can also reveal what stimulus orientation a person is viewing(Kamitani &amp; Tong, 2005). To pick up infomation of orientation and spacial frequency in a natural image. We using the garbor wavelet to project onto every images in different space location, orientation, and spacial frequency, which we called the Gabor wavelet pyramid. As for the Gabor wavelet pyramid. Wavelets occur at five (or, in some cases, six) spatial frequencies. This panel depicts one wavelet at each of the first five spatial frequencies. At each spatial frequency f cycles per field-of-view (FOV), wavelets are positioned on an f × f grid, as indicated by the translucent lines.Orientation and phase. At each grid position, wavelets occur at eight orientations and two phases. This panel depicts a complete set of wavelets for a single grid position. Dashed lines indicate the bounds of the mask associated with each wavelet.(Kay et al., 2008) Showed below. Figure 3. Gabor wavelet pyramid design. There are five different spacial frequency(1,2,4,8,16 FOV). For every single spacial frequency, it has (1,4,16,64,256) types of different position in the visual field. For every position, there are 2 orthogonal phase and 8 different angles(0:22.5:157.5). Together, there are 5456 different gabor wavelets in the Gabor wavelet pyramid. I used the gabor_fn.m function to produce a gabor wavelet for the given sf,angle,phase,posi. from Wikipedia Then, I wrote a function gaborfit.m to produce a set of gabor wavelet image directlly. It produce a martix called gab(128x128x5456).Represent 5456 different gabor wavelet image(128x128). To compute the projection. I wrote compscript.m (section 1). To compute the projection of 5456 wavelets for 1750 images. The projections for each quadrature pair of wavelets are then squared, summed, and square-rooted, yielding a measure of contrast energy. The result will be in the martix called proj(1750x2728). To remove wavelets ouuside the field of the natural images(outside the circle). I wrote a function called gabdelete in gabdelete.m. The result will be in the martix called projdeleteedge(1750x2728). Training algorithm Figure 4. Gabor wavelet pyramid model.. Here we use multi-variation liner regression to build up the model. Using the features which we cauculated before using gabor wavelet pyramid model. We use the tronditional square-root error cost function, and using gradient descent with monument to optimize the cost function. $$h=h- \\varepsilon g$$ $$g=\\left[ \\left[ X’(Xh-y) \\right]+\\alpha g \\right]$$ To prevent over-fitting, we used early stopping. A randomly selected 20% of the data-set were removed and kept as a stopping set. Iterations proceeded until the squared error on the stopping set nolonger decreased, or until the squared error on the training set no longer decreased. I wrote two function to running this regression. inittrain.m and linereg.m The initrain.m is used to pre-processing the dataset, devided it into training set and stopping set for early stopping, and remove NaN data points. The linereg.m is used for running the optimzation of the cost function. Pre-training stageTrainning that models for 25000 voxels is too time-consuming. In order to improve efficiency. We carry a pre-training stage. In order to accelerate the training speed, we tried to reduce dimensions firstly. We did not take orentation into consideration: we averged the 8 gabor wavelet projection for each position. Then we can use that new features to fit the model. Using the weight for every location we can reconstruct the population receptive field. This method is pretty likely to build up a data driven pRF(population receptive field). Figure 5. A given example of the reconstructed pRF. Left img represent a well-fitted voxel, it’s receptive field is very consentrate and sparse. Image in right represent a traditional poorly fitted voxel, it’s receptive field is very confusion. I worte _gaborfield.m to generate a field map using gaussian functions.The RFvis.m is used for reconstructing a population receptive field map for a given voxels, using the weight computed in the pre-trainning stage and the gabor_field.m, sum it up to form a receptive field map.We need to remove those poorly fitted voxels. We have two ways to select voxels. 1. Gaussian FittedWe can using Gaussian function to fitted the reconstructed pRF. The Gaussian RMS width(field vaule in fig 5.) can represent the ‘goodness of fit’, but sometimes some poorly-fitted can also be selected because of some overfitting problem. 2. R-Squared sortingTo quantify the ‘goodness of fit’. We can also using R-Squared vaule directly. We cauculate R2 of those 25000 voxels and make a sorting. And we can choose the top 500 voxels to do the futher analyze. After the R-Squared sorting procedure, the top-10 voxels showed below. Figure 5. Top 10 well-fitted voxels. Figure shows the reconstructed pRF of top 10 well-fitted voxels, it’s all has a relatively ‘sparse’ receptive field The anatomical distribution of those 500 voxels showed below. Figure 6. The anatomical distribution of those 500 voxels. As we can see, a huge amount of voxels are from early visual cortex(V1,V2,V3). I wrote causelectedh.m to select 500 voxels, and further more, to run the main-trainning stage below. Main-training stageHave choosen 500 well-fitted voxels. We fitted those voxels with full features(with 8 orientations).I then use this model to predict 500 voxels activities based on 120 natural images in the test set(120 images).Then, We compute R-Squared vaule between actually response value and the predicted vaule of those 500 voxels among those 120 images, using that to generate a 120x120 image. Figure 6. The correlation map of the actually response value and the predicted vaule of those 500 voxels. The (i,j)position’s color represent the R-Squared vaule between actually response value of the number i th image and the predicted vaule of the j th image of those 500 voxels. I wrote corxcmp.m to predict the activity using test set images, and generate this final result. In the identifation task. We re-match the target’s brain activities with the best correlated predicted brain activities. In my work, without noise ceiling procedures, the identifation performance is about 58.8%, meanwhile, the chance level is about 0.83%. Using the optimized wights in the main-training stage. We could generate a tuning properties image. It could tell us which orinentation and spacial frequency contribute more to the activity of the voxels. As a given example, for the No.23198 voxel, we visualize the weight distribution of the 8 orintations and 5 spacial frequency (5x8). Figure 7. The weight distribution of the 8 orintation and 5 spacial frequency for the voxel 23198. . Further more, we plot the tuning properties for the orintations separately. Figure 8.The tuning properties for the orintations(L) and spacial frequency(R). . We can observe that, this voxel prefer 45 degres, and relevantly prefer higher special frequency.

IntroductionMind-reading is really amazing and exciting. Using modern fMRI(functional magnetic resonance imaging) technique. We can now decoding some infomation from participant’s brain activities. Based on that, I repeated some previous research in Badong Chen’s lab, such as decode fMRI signal from primary visual cortex (V1) and reconstruct pattern image from fMRI signal (Miyawaki et al., 2008). Meanwhile, I improved the accuracy of the reconstruction by about 4% (from about 80% to about 84%), using the improved MVPA method with SVM classifier (Norman et al., 2006). This article is only a berif introduction of my work. You can contact me for the reconstruction result video demo, for the source code and for more detail. ResultsSubjects view 12x12 binary(Black or White) pixels images while recoding their brain activities using fMRI. 352 of which are in random. 80s are in regular (The pattern of them are like numbers, etc.), see figure below. figure 1. Left binary image is in random, right is in regular Then we use GLM procedures to modeling brain activity for every stimuli. Firstly, I use MVPA(Multi-Voxels pattern analyze) to build up a model for every pixel (1x1 scale). We then everaged the vaule of 2 neighbouring pixels vertically (2x1 scale) and horizentally (1x2 scale), and 4 neighbouring pixels (2x2 scale). Figure showed below.(Miyawaki et al., 2008) figure 2. Multi-scale local image bases for buliding MVPA model In MVPA, I firstly choosed 3037 voxels from V1, then caculated Pearson’s r for each voxels. Then sort them using r vaule. We choose the 50 voxels from it(top 30 and last 20). Then we trainning a SVM classifier to build up the MVPA model using 352 random images as a trainning set. The code example showed below. 1function [ SVMStruct,corvox ] = singlevoxtrai(trainingsetnum,posi,beta,stim) %This model train a SVM model to a given posi of the stim % trainingsetnum=1:176; % posi=[6,6]; %% section a,trainnning one single voxal trainingset=beta(:,trainingsetnum); [~,selectvox,~] = voxcor(posi(1,1),posi(1,2),stim(:,:,... trainingsetnum),trainingset);%select the corresponding voxels of the stim Training=beta(selectvox,trainingsetnum)'; Group=reshape(stim(posi(1,1),posi(1,2),:),size(stim,3),1); Group=Group(trainingsetnum,:); SVMStruct = svmtrain(Training,Group,'kernel_function','polynomial'); corvox=selectvox; end Then we use the remaining 80 examples to test our model, using the MVPA models we trainned before, to compute the pixels’ vaule given brain activities. Repeat these procedures to every pixels in 4 scale. After combining 4 scale using liner regression for each pixels. Finally, we got a reconstructed image using subject’s brain activities. We compute deviation using reconstruced image and the actually image (square-root error). The example show below. figure 3.

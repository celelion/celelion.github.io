I learnt these three skills below. Running my own psychophysical experimentsIn Fang’s lab. I learnt to programing with PTB(Psychtoolbox) using MATLAB. I carried out a pre-experiment to see how a prior unambigious SFM(Structure from motion) effects the up-coming bistable SFM. Figure 1. Carrying my own psychophysics experiments The psychophysical protocol show below. Figure 2. The psychophysical protocol of my pre-experiment Then I fitted a psychophysical curve to actually ‘see’ this influence. Dealing with fMRI raw dataThey gave me a fMRI data set used for trainning. Using that, I studied how to use SPM to manipulate these data. Including Preprocessing(Slice-timing correction, Motion Correction, Co-registration, Spacial Normalization, and Spatial Smoothing.), and uni-variation GLM analyze. Figure showed below. Figure 3. Manipulate fMRI raw data using SPM 12 Also, using SPM plug-in tools like XjView and MarsBar, I carried out an ROI analyze. I ploted the BSC in MT+, showed below. Figure 4. Bold signal change percentage in MT+ Reasoning and thinking like a graduate studentSpent 5 weeks in Fang’s lab benifit me a lot. I got familiar with the graduate students in fang’s lab, understood what they do and how they think, reading more research articles based on their recommendation, and discussing about my own experiment. The experience in there promote me to think, to try and to act more. It refresh my plan about what to do in the future. Without this experience, I cannot carry my own research project in the past semester. Thank you professor fang fang, and all lab members in fang’s lab.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Research Experience","slug":"Research-Experience","permalink":"http://www.jingjie.site/categories/Research-Experience/"},{"name":"Study Experience","slug":"Research-Experience/Study-Experience","permalink":"http://www.jingjie.site/categories/Research-Experience/Study-Experience/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Scholar","slug":"Scholar","permalink":"http://www.jingjie.site/tags/Scholar/"},{"name":"fMRI","slug":"fMRI","permalink":"http://www.jingjie.site/tags/fMRI/"},{"name":"PKU","slug":"PKU","permalink":"http://www.jingjie.site/tags/PKU/"},{"name":"Psychophysics","slug":"Psychophysics","permalink":"http://www.jingjie.site/tags/Psychophysics/"},{"name":"Summer School","slug":"Summer-School","permalink":"http://www.jingjie.site/tags/Summer-School/"}]},{"title":"Visual Image Reconstruction using fMRI","slug":"visual_image_reconstruction","date":"2017-01-24T18:19:55.000Z","updated":"2017-01-26T05:44:48.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/01/25/visual_image_reconstruction/","link":"","permalink":"http://www.jingjie.site/2017/01/25/visual_image_reconstruction/","excerpt":"Mind-reading is really amazing and exciting.

IntroductionMind-reading is really amazing and exciting. Using modern fMRI(functional magnetic resonance imaging) technique. We can now decoding some infomation from participant’s brain activities. Based on that, I repeated some previous research in Badong Chen’s lab, such as decode fMRI signal from primary visual cortex (V1) and reconstruct pattern image from fMRI signal (Miyawaki et al., 2008). Meanwhile, I improved the accuracy of the reconstruction by about 4% (from about 80% to about 84%), using the improved MVPA method with SVM classifier (Norman et al., 2006). This article is only a berif introduction of my work. You can contact me for the reconstruction result video demo, for the source code and for more detail. ResultsSubjects view 12x12 binary(Black or White) pixels images while recoding their brain activities using fMRI. 352 of which are in random. 80s are in regular (The pattern of them are like numbers, etc.), see figure below. figure 1. Left binary image is in random, right is in regular Then we use GLM procedures to modeling brain activity for every stimuli. Firstly, I use MVPA(Multi-Voxels pattern analyze) to build up a model for every pixel (1x1 scale). We then everaged the vaule of 2 neighbouring pixels vertically (2x1 scale) and horizentally (1x2 scale), and 4 neighbouring pixels (2x2 scale). Figure showed below.(Miyawaki et al., 2008) figure 2. Multi-scale local image bases for buliding MVPA model In MVPA, I firstly choosed 3037 voxels from V1, then caculated Pearson’s r for each voxels. Then sort them using r vaule. We choose the 50 voxels from it(top 30 and last 20). Then we trainning a SVM classifier to build up the MVPA model using 352 random images as a trainning set. The code example showed below. 1function [ SVMStruct,corvox ] = singlevoxtrai(trainingsetnum,posi,beta,stim) %This model train a SVM model to a given posi of the stim % trainingsetnum=1:176; % posi=[6,6]; %% section a,trainnning one single voxal trainingset=beta(:,trainingsetnum); [~,selectvox,~] = voxcor(posi(1,1),posi(1,2),stim(:,:,... trainingsetnum),trainingset);%select the corresponding voxels of the stim Training=beta(selectvox,trainingsetnum)'; Group=reshape(stim(posi(1,1),posi(1,2),:),size(stim,3),1); Group=Group(trainingsetnum,:); SVMStruct = svmtrain(Training,Group,'kernel_function','polynomial'); corvox=selectvox; end Then we use the remaining 80 examples to test our model, using the MVPA models we trainned before, to compute the pixels’ vaule given brain activities. Repeat these procedures to every pixels in 4 scale. After combining 4 scale using liner regression for each pixels. Finally, we got a reconstructed image using subject’s brain activities. We compute deviation using reconstruced image and the actually image (square-root error). The example show below. figure 3.

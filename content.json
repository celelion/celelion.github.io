Research InterestI’m interested in cognitive neuroscience. I would like to seek for how our brain interpret the sensory signal, particularly the visual perception. Topics including attentional modulation, the expectation effect and the predictive coding in sensory processing. Now, I’m trying to interpret why intermittent presented SFM can stablization subject’s perception. Using combination of psychphysical experiments and functional imagining.
